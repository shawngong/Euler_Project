Catch_Toad-
===========

A 2D slider game made in python using pygame. 
  The player controls "mario" using the arrow keys, and must collect all the "toads" on the screen by hovering over them. All the while, "toads" are spawning randomly across the screen. A score tracker at the top of the screen indicates the number of "toads" the player has caught (try to win with as small of a score as possible). The player wins when there are no more "toads" on the screen and has the option to continue onto the next level. Each successive level is harder, as the "toads" spawn faster. See if you can complete all 8 levels. Warning: The game is A LOT harder than it sounds.
